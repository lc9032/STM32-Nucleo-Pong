# STM32-Nucleo-Pong

This project is a classic Pong game that utilizes an LCD display and rotary encoders
for paddle movement. Pong is a two-player sports game that simulates table tennis. In
the game, the players control a paddle by dragging it vertically across the screen's left
or right side. The objective is to hit the ball back and forth between the two paddles.
The game has a scoring system that keeps track of each player's score. The game's
speed increases as the score goes up, making it more challenging for the players to
keep up. In addition to the two-player mode, an AI mode has also been implemented.
The AI will move the paddle automatically and try to hit the ball. The game has been
implemented using the C programming language and the STM32CubeIDE
development environment.
